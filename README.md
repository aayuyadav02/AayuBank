# Bank Management System

## Introduction
The **Bank Management System** is a Java-based application that provides basic banking functionalities such as creating accounts, managing transactions, checking account balances, and other banking-related operations. The project is designed to demonstrate the application of Core Java concepts such as Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), file handling, exception handling, and more.

## Features
- **Account Management**: Create, update, and delete customer accounts.
- **Transaction Management**: Perform deposit, withdrawal, and transfer operations.
- **Balance Inquiry**: Check account balance.
- **Transaction History**: View transaction logs.
- **User Authentication**: Secure access using account credentials.

## Technologies Used
- Programming Language: **Java** (Core Java)
- Development Environment: **Eclipse/IntelliJ IDEA/NetBeans**
- Storage: **File Handling** or **Database (optional)**

## Requirements
- **Java Development Kit (JDK)** 8 or higher
- Integrated Development Environment (IDE) such as IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or NetBeans

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/bank-management-system.git
   ```
2. Open the project in your preferred Java IDE.
3. Ensure the JDK is properly configured in the IDE.
4. Run the `Main.java` file to start the application.

## Usage
1. Launch the application.
2. Choose from the menu options to:
   - Create a new bank account
   - Deposit or withdraw money
   - View account details
   - Exit the application

## Core Java Concepts Used
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**: Classes, Objects, Inheritance, Polymorphism
- **Exception Handling**: Managing runtime errors gracefully
- **Collections Framework**: Using ArrayList, HashMap, etc., for data management
- **File Handling**: Storing and retrieving account and transaction data
- **Modular Design**: Clean separation of concerns with multiple classes

## Future Enhancements
- Integration with a relational database (e.g., MySQL or PostgreSQL)
- GUI implementation using JavaFX or Swing
- Adding advanced features like interest calculation, loan management, and account statements
